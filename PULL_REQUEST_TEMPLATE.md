#### Single-line Summary
**Today, John and Matt paired together. It took about 4**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on preparing our index.html page by adding the scripts that were missing.
  2. Next, we completed the handlebars template in the index.html page.
  3. Then, we completed the repo .js to get our git hub repo json data.
  4. Next, we completed the repoView.js by adding the handlebars compile function.
  5. Then, we called app.repos.requestRepos(app.repoView.index); in the aboutController.js, this called the function to get our api and then rendered it on the dom.
